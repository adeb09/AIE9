### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A **GitHub account** (free tier is fine) with a **Personal Access Token** (fine-grained, `repo` scope)
- An **X (Twitter) Developer account** with a Bearer Token (Free tier provides basic access)
- **Python 3.11+** installed
- Basic familiarity with LangGraph (Sessions 4-6) and Python

Create a `.env` file in this directory with your API keys:

1. Run `uv sync` to install dependencies.

# Build 🏗️

### Social Listening → GitHub Issue Triage Pipeline

Build an automated pipeline that bridges **social media signals to GitHub project management** — all orchestrated through your LangGraph agent.

**Requirements:**

1. **Social Listening**: Use the X API tools to search for posts mentioning a specific open-source project or technology of your choice (e.g., `"langchain bug"`, `"langgraph feature request"`, `"#llamaindex issue"`). Retrieve at least 20 posts.

2. **Post Classification**: Instruct the agent to classify each retrieved post into one of these categories:
   - `bug_report` — user is reporting a problem
   - `feature_request` — user is suggesting a new capability
   - `question` — user is asking for help
   - `praise` — user is sharing positive feedback
   - `general` — none of the above

   The agent should output structured reasoning for each classification.

3. **Automated Issue Creation**: For posts classified as `bug_report` or `feature_request`, use the GitHub MCP tools to automatically create issues in a new repository. Each issue should include:
   - A descriptive title summarizing the social media post
   - Body containing: original post text, classification category, the agent's reasoning, and a suggested priority level (`low` / `medium` / `high`)
   - Appropriate label(s) matching the classification

4. **Digest Report**: Ask the agent to generate a `social-listening-digest.md` that summarizes:
   - Total posts analyzed and breakdown by category
   - Issues created (with links)
   - Sentiment overview across all posts
   - Recommended action items for maintainers

5. **Full Git Workflow**: Use the MCP tools to commit the digest on a new branch and open a PR with a meaningful description.

When submitting, provide:
- Your Loom video link demonstrating the pipeline end-to-end
- The GitHub URL to your completed Advanced Build repository (with issues and PRs visible)

Have fun!

# Submitting Your Homework

### Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE9 repo:
  - *(You should have completed this process already.)* For your initial repo setup, see [Initial_Setup](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)
    - To get the latest updates from AI Makerspace into your own AIE9 repo, run the following commands:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```
2. **IMPORTANT:** Start Cursor from the `14_MCP_Connectors` folder (you can also use the *File -> Open Folder* menu option of an existing Cursor window)
3. Answer Questions 1 - 3 using the `##### Answer:` markdown cell below them in `Session_14_MCP_Connectors.ipynb`
4. Complete Activity #1 in Breakout Room #1 and Activity #1 in Breakout Room #2 in `Session_14_MCP_Connectors.ipynb`
5. Add, commit and push your modified notebooks to your GitHub repository.

When submitting your homework, provide:

- Your Loom video link
- The GitHub URL to the `14_MCP_Connectors` folder on your assignment branch
- The GitHub URL to your `x-post-summarizer-2026` repository
