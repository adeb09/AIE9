    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BM25 will be better than embeddings (vector search) in scenarios where the input query contains rare words or text that may not be embedded well into any embedding model\n",
    "- IE: say you are a nurse asking a question particular to an ICD-10 code (codes that identify diseases) in your query to the RAG prompt\n",
    "  - since BM25 internally uses `TF-IDF`, it will actually give a high score to chunks of data that contain this ICD-10 code and score it highly because ICD-10 codes are pretty rare\n",
    "  - in an embedding model, the ICD-10 code may not even exist since they are usually very rare (you may need to utilize an embedding model that is specifically trained/used on healthcare/electronic medical record data)\n",
    "  - so anytime a rare keyword is important to an input query or question (any sort of keyword search), BM25 will do much better than an embedding model because the semantic meaning of the query doesn't matter as much as the keywords do\n",

    "## Task 8: Parent Document Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
    "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",
    "3. The child chunks are stored in a VectorStore, while the parent chunks are stored in an in-memory docstore.\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the child chunks.\n",
    "5. Instead of returning the child chunks, we return their associated parent chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search** for small, focused chunks (better semantic matching)\n",
    "- **Return** big chunks (richer surrounding context)\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that we're likely to find the most relevant information by limiting the amount of semantic information encoded in each embedding vector - but we're likely to miss relevant surrounding context if we only use that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by defining our parent and child splitters."

During sleep, the body repairs tissues, consolidates memories, and releases hormones that help regulate growth and appetite.

Good sleep hygiene—such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment—can improve sleep quality. Adequate sleep supports vital bodily functions, enhances mood, boosts immune function, and promotes better mental clarity and learning. Conversely, poor sleep or sleep disturbances can lead to various health issues, including increased risk of chronic conditions, impaired immune response, and mental health challenges.'"

During sleep, the body repairs tissues, regenerates cells, consolidates memories, and releases important hormones that regulate growth and appetite. Adults generally need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, with sleep occurring in cycles that include REM and non-REM stages, each contributing to different restorative processes. Good sleep quality, maintained through proper sleep hygiene practices like a consistent routine, a comfortable environment, and limiting screens before bed, is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Poor sleep can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and low energy, and over time, can increase the risk of chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders.'"

    "### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "- the problem with short and highly repetitive sentences (like FAQs) is that many consecutive sentences might be very similar to each other (especially in the embedding space) which will make it difficult to find chunk boundaries with semantic chunking\n",
    "  - the distances from similar sentences will be very small, so thresholding types such as percentile, standard deviation, and interquartile will all have issues finding chunk boundaries (there will be too few boundaries)\n",
    "    - percentile considers the all the distances between consecutive sentences and creates a chunk boundary past a certain percentile threshold (IE 95th percentile)\n",
    "      - but with FAQs, all distances will be very similar (close to uniformly distributed) so the 95th percentile might still be very low causing not enough splits\n",
    "    - the standard deviation threshold type calculates the mean and standard deviation of all consecutive sentence distances and creates a chunk boundary when a distance exceeds `mean + k * std dev` (the parameter k controls the sensitivity)\n",
    "      - this is more adaptative to your document but with FAQs, the standard deviation will be low so small variations could lead to over-splitting\n",
    "    - the interquartile threshold type utilizes the middle 50th percentile of distances (`IQR = Q3 - Q1`) and creates a chunk boundary when distances are greater than `Q3 + k * IQR`\n",
    "      - this is similar to the issue with standard deviaton; FAQs will have a very small IQR due to so many similar chunks so the IQR method may be too sensitive and create too many chunk boundaries\n",
    "- I would adjust the algorithm by utilizing the gradient threshold type\n",
    "  - instead of looking at absolute distances, the gradient method looks at the rate of change in distances\n",
    "  - it creates a chunk boundary when there is a sudden change (or rate of change) in distances (it detects jumps in semantic dissimilarity)\n",
    "  - gradient thresholding will perform better than the other threshold types for finding meaningful chunk boundaries and topic changes with repetitive sentences (like FAQs) since it is looking at the rate of change in distance instead of absolute distance"

    " **Multi-Query Retriever Performance**\n",
    "  - Multi-query achieved the highest context recall (0.90), showing it successfully retrieved more relevant information by generating multiple query variations\n",
    "  - However, it had the lowest factual correctness (0.503), suggesting that casting a wider net retrieved more context but potentially introduced less precise information\n",
    "  - Strong answer relevancy (0.903) indicates the retrieved context was still relevant to answering the questions\n",
    "  - multi-query retriever definitely requires more performance considerations (since you have to generate more query versions from an LLM)\n",
    "    - so testing this method comes at a cost of price & latency (price due to more LLM API calls and latency due to need time to generate the other query formulations)\n",
    "\n",
    " **Semantic Chunking**\n",
    "  - Semantic chunking with naive retrieval showed the highest answer relevancy (0.960) and best faithfulness (0.881), meaning answers were more relevant and grounded in the retrieved context\n",
    "  - However, it had the lowest context recall (0.828), suggesting semantic boundaries created chunks that were missed during retrieval\n",
    "  - Best context entity recall (0.307) shows semantic chunking better preserved entity relationships within chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs**\n",
    "  - Recall vs. Precision trade-off: Multi-query gets more context (high recall) but lower factual correctness, while naive retrieval is more precise but retrieves less\n",
    "  - Chunking strategy matters: Semantic chunking improved answer quality metrics (relevancy, faithfulness) but at the cost of recall\n",
    "  - no method by itself was an obvious winner; each approach was better for different metrics which reinforces the idea that you have to test different retrieval strategies for your own RAG application and its unique data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaways**\n",
    "  - If your use case requires comprehensive information retrieval, multi-query is superior\n",
    "  - If answer accuracy and relevance are critical, semantic chunking with proper retrieval tuning may be better\n",
    "  - The \"best\" retriever depends on whether you optimize for recall, precision, or answer quality\n",
    "  - it would be interesting to test semantic chunking with multiquery retrieval to see how the retrieval metrics would have compared (that would be my next experiment)"
